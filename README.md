# QR Code Component

This is a solution to the **QR Code Component** challenge on Frontend Mentor. The goal of this project was to build a simple, responsive QR card component using only HTML and CSS while following best practices for layout, accessibility, and responsiveness.

## 🛠 Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Flexbox for layout
- Responsive design principles
- Google Fonts (Outfit)
- Git & GitHub Pages for deployment

## ✨ What I Learned

Working on this project helped me to:

- Structure HTML using semantic elements like `main`, headings, and paragraphs
- Center content vertically and horizontally using Flexbox
- Use relative units (`rem`) instead of absolute units for better accessibility
- Apply CSS variables for cleaner and more maintainable styles
- Deploy a static website live using GitHub Pages

## 🚀 Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to:
- Improve accessibility even further
- Explore more responsive techniques using `clamp()` and media queries
- Build more Frontend Mentor challenges to strengthen my frontend fundamentals

## 🙌 Acknowledgements

Thanks to **Frontend Mentor** for providing practical challenges that help improve real-world frontend development skills.
